Description
===========
Reviewing some computer science basics.

This is for fun, comment out lines and edit variables or calls in `main.cpp` to 
get different results. Be careful with Bogosort, anything more than a few
elements can get out of hand.

Compile
=======
Because I'll forget how...

GNU
---

    g++ main.cpp sort_functions.cpp -o test.exe


Visual Studios
--------------
Copy and paste is the key.


Compileing with g++ sort time functions become useless, they're all 0. On the
other hand, compiling in Visual Studios will give a result in seconds (fractions
of seconds in most cases) even with the default of only 4 elements. Aparently 
Visual Studios takes a long time to cout.
